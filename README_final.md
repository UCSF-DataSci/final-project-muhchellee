# Hidden Markov Model for Gene Region Prediction in Plasmodium falciparum  
Individual project (Michelle Li)  

## Overview  
### Background  
Gene prediction in malaria parasites presents unique computational challenges due to the distinctive genomic characteristics of Plasmodium falciparum. Traditional gene prediction algorithms often struggle with the AT-rich genome (approximately 80% AT content) and the compact gene structure typical of this parasite. This project implements a novel Hidden Markov Model (HMM) specifically optimized for P. falciparum genomic sequences to improve gene boundary prediction accuracy.  

**Objective:** Develop and evaluate a biologically-informed HMM that can accurately distinguish between exonic (protein-coding) and intergenic regions in P. falciparum genomic sequences, leveraging the organism's unique nucleotide composition patterns and gene structure characteristics.

**Significance:** Accurate gene prediction in malaria parasites is crucial for:  
- Understanding parasite biology and pathogenesis
- Identifying potential drug targets
- Advancing malaria research and treatment development
- Improving genome annotation quality

## Tools/Methods Used  
### Core Libraries:
- `numpy`
- `matplotlib`/`seaborn`
- `scikit-learn`
- `Bio`
- `pandas`
  
### HMM Algorithm Architecture
- **States:** 2 (intergenic, exonic/gene)
- **Observations:** DNA nucleotides (A/T/G/C)
Algorithm implemented with biologically-informed priors, balanced training, log-space calculations with epsilon thresholds, and adaptive window sizing.

### Model Training  
- **Parameter Estimation:** Baum-Welch (Maximum Likelihood estimation with Bayesian priors)  
- **Regularization:** Pseudocount strength of 20 for balanced leraning
- Emission probabilities were learned from nucleotide composition data and transition probabilities were constrained from biological knowledge.

### Prediction and Evaluation
- **Viterbi**: Optimal state sequence prediction
- **Forward**: Probability scores for AUC calculation
- **Evaluation Metrics:** accuracy, precision, recall, F1, AUC-ROC
  

## Implementation Decisions
A **sliding window approach** with overlapping windows was done to enable batch processing of a large dataset and to provide more training examples. While a normal sliding window approach may result in more genes being split across decision boundaries, the overlap should help to mitigate this and allow for local sequence context modeling. **Adaptive window sizing** was also done based on the chromosome length to balance computational efficiency with biological relevance.
  
A simplified **binary state model** was selected (exonic/gene vs intergenic) as opposed to also including intron/exon boundaries as it reduces model complexity while ensuring we are focusing only on our task, which is gene prediction. The **Forward Algorithm** was used for probability scoring as opposed to using only Viterbi, which may have been more computationally heavy but it allows for downstream ROC analysis and continuous prediction scores.

## Issues Encountered
Probability underflow was an issue as we have a large genomic sequencing dataset. To mitigate this, I did log-space calculations in the Viterbi algorithm, implemented epsilon thresholds to prevent log(0), and normalized in the Forward algorithm. 
  
Class imbalance (varying exonic/gene vs intergenic ratios) was addressed by using balanced pseudocount regularization, calculating performance metrics across each class, and evaluating the model with AUC.

### Limitations and Future Work
This current implementation focuses on individual chromosomes. Future work could be extended to more chromosomes as well as implement a multi-state model for more detailed annotation.
